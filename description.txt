I use a basic singly linked list with no dummy head node to read data from a file, if it a  number, float or int, it is stored into the list, if the data is not a number, it is stored as a string variable when it is compared to math operators and then that operator is performed on the first 2 numbers in the stack, via pop, the sum is stored in a variable and then the sum is stored on the op of the stack.
